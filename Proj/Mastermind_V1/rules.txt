                             Welcome to Mastermind
In our game of Mastermind, instead of colors, we utilize numbers. The computer
becomes the "codemaker", choosing a combination of numbers. You are the
"codebreaker", trying to crack the code.

Here we have 3 levels of difficulty.
Easy: numbers range from 1-6 with 4 holes and 12 tries.
Medium: numbers ranging from 1-6 with 5 holes and 12 tries.
Hard: numbers range from 1-9 with 6 holes and 8 tries.

You can also choose custom settings for your liking.
The numbers available range from 1 to the number of your choosing: 
	(6 minimum: 1-6, 9 maximum: 1-9).
The amount of holes: (4 minimum, 6 maximum). and
The number of tries: (6 minimum, 12 maximum).

When you enter a code, enter it in the following format:
	1234, 12345, or 123456.
	
The code you enter must match the exact code from the codemaker. Each time you
enter your code, you will be notified as to how many colors are correct and how
many are in the correct spot. For example, you may have entered 1234 for your
try, and the code is 4321. The codemaker will notify you that you have 4 numbers
correct but none in the correct spot. That information will be represent with
X's and O's. 

O's represent correct numbers in correct positions.
X's represent correct numbers in incorrect positions.

OOXX shows 2 numbers correct in position, 2 numbers correct out of position.
OXX  shows 1 number correct in position, 2 numbers correct out of position.

You can then take that information to help you decipher the code. Try to break
the code in as few tries as possible. Duplicate Numbers are allowed.
                                Enjoy your game!
